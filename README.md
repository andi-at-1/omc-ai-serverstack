# Self-hosted AI Package

**Self-hosted AI Package** is an open, docker compose template that
quickly bootstraps a fully featured Local AI and Low Code development,
modified to fit the OMC-DEV-STACK

### What‚Äôs included

‚úÖ [**Self-hosted n8n**](https://n8n.io/) - Low-code platform with over 400
integrations and advanced AI components

‚úÖ [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/) - Open source database as a service -
most widely used database for AI agents

‚úÖ [**Open WebUI**](https://openwebui.com/) - ChatGPT-like interface to
privately interact with your local models and N8N agents

‚úÖ [**Flowise**](https://flowiseai.com/) - No/low code AI agent
builder that pairs very well with n8n

‚úÖ [**Qdrant**](https://qdrant.tech/) - Open source, high performance vector
store with an comprehensive API. Even though you can use Supabase for RAG, this was
kept unlike Postgres since it's faster than Supabase so sometimes is the better option.

‚úÖ [**Neo4j**](https://neo4j.com/) - Knowledge graph engine that powers tools like GraphRAG, LightRAG, and Graphiti 

‚úÖ [**Langfuse**](https://langfuse.com/) - Open source LLM engineering platform for agent observability

## Prerequisites

docker from it¬¥s repo, python, python-is-python3

## Installation

Before running the services, you need to set up your environment variables for Supabase following their [self-hosting guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#securing-your-services).

cp .env.example .env
nano .env

Set the following required environment variables:
   ```bash
   ############
   # N8N Configuration
   ############
   N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=
   N8N_USER_MANAGEMENT_JWT_SECRET=

   ############
   # Supabase Secrets
   ############
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
   JWT_SECRET=
   ANON_KEY=
   SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
   DASHBOARD_USERNAME=
   DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=
   POOLER_TENANT_ID=

   ############
   # Neo4j Secrets
   ############   
   NEO4J_AUTH=

   ############
   # Langfuse credentials
   ############

   CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=
   MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=
   LANGFUSE_SALT=
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=  
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to generate secure random values for all secrets. Never use the example values in production.

3. Set the following environment variables TO THE DESIRED REVERSEPROXY HOSTS!
   ```bash
   N8N_HOSTNAME=n8n.yourdomain.com
   WEBUI_HOSTNAME=:openwebui.yourdomain.com
   FLOWISE_HOSTNAME=:flowise.yourdomain.com
   SUPABASE_HOSTNAME=:supabase.yourdomain.com
   NEO4J_HOSTNAME=neo4j.yourdomain.com
   ```   

---

```bash
python start_services.py --profile none --environment omc
```
- **omc:** you are deploying the stack in a safe environment, hence a lot of ports can be made accessible without having to worry about security





## Upgrading

To update all containers to their latest versions (n8n, Open WebUI, etc.), run these commands:

```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.yml --profile <your-profile> down

# Pull latest versions of all containers
docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.yml --profile <your-profile> pull

# Start services again with your desired profile
python start_services.py --profile <your-profile>
```

Replace `<your-profile>` with one of: `cpu`, `gpu-nvidia`, `gpu-amd`, or `none`.

Note: The `start_services.py` script itself does not update containers - it only restarts them or pulls them if you are downloading these containers for the first time. To get the latest versions, you must explicitly run the commands above.


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start and usage

The main component of the self-hosted AI starter kit is a docker compose file
pre-configured with network and disk so there isn‚Äôt much else you need to
install. After completing the installation steps above, follow the steps below
to get started.

1. Open <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser to set up n8n. You‚Äôll only
   have to do this once. You are NOT creating an account with n8n in the setup here,
   it is only a local account for your instance!
2. Open the included workflow:
   <http://localhost:5678/workflow/vTN9y2dLXqTiDfPT>
3. Create credentials for every service:
   
   openai URL: http://172.20.1.1

   Postgres (through Supabase): use DB, username, and password from .env. IMPORTANT: Host is 'db'
   Since that is the name of the service running Supabase

   Qdrant URL: http://qdrant:6333 (API key can be whatever since this is running locally)

   Google Drive: Follow [this guide from n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).
   Don't use localhost for the redirect URI, just use another domain you have, it will still work!
   Alternatively, you can set up [local file triggers](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.localfiletrigger/).
4. Select **Test workflow** to start running the workflow.
5. If this is the first time you‚Äôre running the workflow, you may need to wait
   until Ollama finishes downloading Llama3.1. You can inspect the docker
   console logs to check on the progress.
6. Make sure to toggle the workflow as active and copy the "Production" webhook URL!
7. Open <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser to set up Open WebUI.
You‚Äôll only have to do this once. You are NOT creating an account with Open WebUI in the 
setup here, it is only a local account for your instance!
8. Go to Workspace -> Functions -> Add Function -> Give name + description then paste in
the code from `n8n_pipe.py`

   The function is also [published here on Open WebUI's site](https://openwebui.com/f/coleam/n8n_pipe/).

9. Click on the gear icon and set the n8n_url to the production URL for the webhook
you copied in a previous step.
10. Toggle the function on and now it will be available in your model dropdown in the top left! 

To open n8n at any time, visit <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser.
To open Open WebUI at any time, visit <http://localhost:3000/>.

With your n8n instance, you‚Äôll have access to over 400 integrations and a
suite of basic and advanced AI nodes such as
[AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/),
[Text classifier](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/),
and [Information Extractor](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.information-extractor/)
nodes. To keep everything local, just remember to use the Ollama node for your
language model and Qdrant as your vector store.

> [!NOTE]
> This starter kit is designed to help you get started with self-hosted AI
> workflows. While it‚Äôs not fully optimized for production environments, it
> combines robust components that work well together for proof-of-concept
> projects. You can customize it to meet your specific needs





## Troubleshooting

Here are solutions to common issues you might encounter:

### Supabase Issues

- **Supabase Pooler Restarting**: If the supabase-pooler container keeps restarting itself, follow the instructions in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/30210#issuecomment-2456955578).

- **Supabase Analytics Startup Failure**: If the supabase-analytics container fails to start after changing your Postgres password, delete the folder `supabase/docker/volumes/db/data`.

- **If using Docker Desktop**: Go into the Docker settings and make sure "Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS" is turned on

- **Supabase Service Unavailable** - Make sure you don't have an "@" character in your Postgres password! If the connection to the kong container is working (the container logs say it is receiving requests from n8n) but n8n says it cannot connect, this is generally the problem from what the community has shared. Other characters might not be allowed too, the @ symbol is just the one I know for sure!

- **SearXNG Restarting**: If the SearXNG container keeps restarting, run the command "chmod 755 searxng" within the local-ai-packaged folder so SearXNG has the permissions it needs to create the uwsgi.ini file.

- **Files not Found in Supabase Folder** - If you get any errors around files missing in the supabase/ folder like .env, docker/docker-compose.yml, etc. this most likely means you had a "bad" pull of the Supabase GitHub repository when you ran the start_services.py script. Delete the supabase/ folder within the Local AI Package folder entirely and try again.

### GPU Support Issues

- **Windows GPU Support**: If you're having trouble running Ollama with GPU support on Windows with Docker Desktop:
  1. Open Docker Desktop settings
  2. Enable WSL 2 backend
  3. See the [Docker GPU documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/gpu/) for more details

- **Linux GPU Support**: If you're having trouble running Ollama with GPU support on Linux, follow the [Ollama Docker instructions](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/docker.md).

## Tips & tricks

### Accessing local files

The self-hosted AI starter kit will create a shared folder (by default,
located in the same directory) which is mounted to the n8n container and
allows n8n to access files on disk. This folder within the n8n container is
located at `/data/shared` -- this is the path you‚Äôll need to use in nodes that
interact with the local filesystem.
